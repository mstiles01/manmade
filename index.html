          <h1>About The Creator</h1>
          <br>
          <p>Ben McGraw ,the creator of Man Made&#8482, is a savant of all things fashion. His story is that of humble beginings in the bayous of Louisiana. Growing up in the wetlands, his passion burned for greater things.</p> <p>Ben then joined the Marine Corp. following the blue print of being a well rounded man set by the famed Renaissance writer Benvenuto Cellini: "A well-rounded man is an artist, warrior, and philosopher. " </p>
          <p>After serving in the United States armed forces, he then decided to attend seminary, where he answered another calling. One to server in the pulpit of the local church in Greenville, Tx. While doing this Ben met Greg Fields ,a connoisseur of fine scents and clothing, after meeting Greg the cycle of a well rounded man was nearly complete.</p>
          <p>Inspired by the antlers of a deer, Ben created his first piece of work, and since this there has been no slowing down the proverbal tidal wave of creativty. He has since combined Navaho beads into his work to pay homage to the Navaho people, who a truly connected to this earth.</p>
